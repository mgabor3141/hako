# Global Instructions

**Precedence:** Repo/project AGENTS.md > this file > system prompt. When instructions conflict, the more specific source wins.

## This Environment (hako)

You are running inside hako: a sandboxed, containerized agent environment, preconfigured with a curated dev toolchain (node, bun, python, git, jj, ripgrep, fd, jq, and more, via `mise`) so you can start working right away. You hold no credentials: the gateway holds them, and external writes are approval-gated. Task-specific capabilities are exposed as skills, loaded when relevant.

## Verify, Don't Assume

When working on a service or system, don't stop at "it's running". Spot-check that it's working *correctly*: query APIs, compare config values, check actual runtime state. Flag discrepancies even if they're outside the immediate task scope.

## Testing

Not everything needs a test, but when something does, make sure you write good tests. You know what makes a good test: you don't need me to tell you that it should test code behavior over implementation details. Bad tests for example test language features, specific strings that can change over time making them brittle, do more harm than good and should be eradicated like the plague.

Never modify test inputs, fixtures, or synthetic data to make assertions pass. If a test can't distinguish correct from incorrect behavior with real data, the test is wrong, not the data. Fix the assertion or acknowledge the gap.

## Types

The type system is your friend. It helps you by flagging that your prior assumptions no longer hold true. Encode your assumptions in the type system. Never bypass the type system by using `any` or other means, if you feel you need to you are likely approaching the problem wrong. Step back and reassess.

## Focused Solutions

You might have heard that "defense in depth" or "belt and suspenders" approaches can be useful, but in practice most of the time these are just excuses for poor understanding of the problem. Is the additional fallback due to general uncertainty of the problem space, or just that you didn't feel like looking into the details enough to know what is actually useful to add?

## Writing Style

Avoid using emdashes. They are an indicator of "AI slop" and undermine credibility. Prefer commas, semicolons, colons, or separate sentences.

## Write for the Reader

Text you post for others to read later (PR descriptions, reviews, commit messages, code comments, issues, docs) serves humans first and agents second. The job is the fastest path to understanding, not a record of everything you did. Every line is a cost; default to cutting. (This is about posted artifacts, not your live replies in a conversation.)

Don't restate what the reader can already see: the code, the types, the tests, the diff. Capture the *why*, especially why not the obvious alternative, not the *what* that's already there. Prefer a link to the exact line, ticket, comment, or PR over restating it. Fold genuinely optional depth (full payloads, long enumerations, edge cases) into a `<details>` block, but collapsing is not a substitute for cutting.

## Git Pushing (hako)

You run git in real checkouts. Cloning and reading need nothing. Pushing needs a credential your human sets up once (the one credential you are trusted to hold); it persists in the home. If `git push` fails with an auth error, do not retry variations or try to obtain a token yourself: stop and tell your human which `owner/repo` you need push access to, and point them at `docs/git.md`. Opening or merging PRs goes through the `github` tool (approval-gated), not git.

## Tool Gotchas

The `Edit` and `Write` tools take `newText` as a JSON string. JSON escapes are decoded before the bytes hit disk: `\\` becomes a single `\`, `\n` becomes a real newline, `\t` a tab. To write a literal single backslash (bash line-continuation `\`, regex escape `\.`, Windows path), put `\\` in `newText`. To write two literal backslashes, put `\\\\`. When unsure, sanity-check with `cat -A` after the edit; backslash-significant content in shell, regex, and config files is the most common place to get this wrong silently.

## Maintaining AGENTS.md Files

When editing AGENTS.md files: keep them brief, be proactive about adding critical learnings as you encounter them.
